# DATA-ANALYST-TASK
Data Analyst internship project at ELEVATE LAB focused on data collection, cleaning, EDA, and visualization using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL. Aimed at uncovering insights, identifying trends, and supporting data-driven decisions through analysis and reporting

TASK - 1

Description:
This task is part of my ongoing Data Analyst internship. The goal was to clean and prepare raw data for analysis.

Tasks Done:
Handled missing values using .isnull() in Python and filters in Excel
Removed duplicate rows using .drop_duplicates() and Excel’s "Remove Duplicates"
Standardized text values (e.g., gender, country names)
Converted dates to dd-mm-yyyy format
Renamed columns (lowercase, no spaces)
Fixed data types (e.g., age as int, date as datetime)


Tools Used:
Python (Pandas)
Microsoft Excel

TASK-2
Key Insights

Sales by Region/State: Identifies top-performing and underperforming markets to guide strategic focus.
Sales Trend Over Time: Tracks monthly and yearly sales to detect seasonality and growth patterns.
Product Performance: Analyzes sales across product categories and sub-categories, aiding inventory and marketing decisions.
Customer Segments: Evaluates the contribution of different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) to overall revenue, helping target the right audience.
Shipping Mode Impact: Examines how shipping modes affect delivery time and customer purchasing behavior, revealing areas for logistics optimization.

TASK-3
Key SQL Tasks Performed

Data Selection & Filtering:
Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to filter, sort, and group data for better analysis.
Joins:
Applied INNER JOIN to combine data from multiple tables for deeper insights.
Subqueries:
Used nested queries to perform complex filtering and calculations.
Aggregate Functions:
Implemented functions like SUM and AVG to calculate total sales, average order value, and other key metrics.
Views Creation:
Created reusable VIEWS for simplified and efficient data access.
Query Optimization:
Used INDEXES to speed up data retrieval and enhance performance.

Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL)
