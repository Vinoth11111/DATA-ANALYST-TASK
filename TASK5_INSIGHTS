* SHAPE OF THE DATASET - 705 ROWS AND 13 COLUMNS(SMALL DATASET)
* DATASET IS CLEAN AND DOESNOT COUNTAIN ANY NULL VALUES AND DUPLICATED VALUES
* FROM DESCRIBE()WE CAN SEE THAT FIRST QUATAIL RANGE OF DATA ARE

* GENDER COUNTS ARE 
Gender
Female    353
Male      352  SO BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ARE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED

* USED PAIR PLOT TO FIND CORRECLATION BETWEEN EACH AND EVERY COLUMNS BETWEEN THEM.
* MOST OF THE COLUMNS ARE POSITEVELY AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED AMOUNG THEM


* DF.CORR() IS USED TO FIND THE CORRELATION FOR NUMERICAL COLUMNS AND THE RESULT ARE IN BETWEEN +1 TO -1

* HISTOGRAM ARE USED TO FIND THE DISTRIBUTION FOR COUNTIONOUES VARIABLE(AGE)
* USED BOXPLOT TO FIND THE POSSIBLE OUTLAIRS IN THE AGE COLUMNMS IN THIS DATA SET NO OULAIRS IS FOUND

* USED SCATTER PLOT ACROSS AGE AND Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours AND FOUND NEGATIVE CORRELATION EXISTS AMOUNG THEM.
